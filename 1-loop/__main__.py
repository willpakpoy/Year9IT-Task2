# Pseudocode

1. Build and generate the Tkinter window.
2. Pick a random number
3. Create the dynamic variables for Tkinter.
4. On button click:
    1. Print the two number values.
    2. Compare the generated number to the inputted one.
        1. If the inputted number is correct, print correct and TODO: unpack the other UI elements.
        2. If the number is higher or lower than the generated number, increment the guesses counter and update the status variable.
