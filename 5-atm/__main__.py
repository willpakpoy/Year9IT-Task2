# Pseudocode
ANCHOR: Pseudocode

1. We request the user to enter their pin.
    1. If they get this wrong, they have three attempts, and then are sent to the "pin jail" for two minutes.
2. The user is presented with a menu.
    a.  Balance
        The user has the chance to view their balance, and see their highest allowed withdrawal amount.
        This information is pulled from the "datastore" variable, which loads it's imformation from the "atm-data.json" file.
        The highest allowded withdrawal amount is calculated by finding the highest possible power of 10 in the balance. 
    b.  Withdrawal
        The user can "withdraw" money from their account.
        This simply checks if the requesting withdrawal amount is less than the balance, and then if so subtracts the withdrawal amount from the balance
        in the datastore, and then logs this transaction using the "log_transaction" function.
        It then displays a successful completion message.
        If the user requests to withdraw another amount not listed, we check if it is a power of 10, and then follow the steps above, but using a custom number.
