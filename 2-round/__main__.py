# Pseudocode

1. Ask the user the three numerical values, being counts of total, joe and jane's rounds.
2. On submit, we run the compute function.
    1. First, we check to ensure the total number of rounds is higher than zero.
    2. Next, we check if Joe or Jane's number of rounds is higher than the total.
    3. We then check if their combined number of rounds is higher than the total.
    4. We divide the number of rounds by 2, and check if Joe or Jane's number of rounds is higher. We then alert the user accordingly through the win_status variable.
    5. If none of the other requirements are met, we calculate how many more rounds Jane must win to win the game.
